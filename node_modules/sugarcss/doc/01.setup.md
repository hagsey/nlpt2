## Setup

Sugar need to be setup in order to suit your particular needs. Here's how you can do that.

### Configure Sugar

In order for Sugar to work, the `sugar()` mixin **needs to be run**. This is where you can pass your configuration variables.
Each "modules" have his particular settings object passed in the sugar mixin so each settings will be explained in his respective module.


```fn
@include sugar( {settings} );
```

```scss
$settings : (
	
	// if want a reset css
	reset : true,

	// if want that box-sizing : border-box is applied
	// for every elements in your css
	border-box : true

	// others modules settings...

);
@include sugar($settings);
```

You need to specify only the settings that you want to override
