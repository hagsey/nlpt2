## Packages

Sugar comes with some very useful and used packages out of the box.

### Sassdash 0.8.0

[Sassdash](https://github.com/davidkpiano/sassdash) (by [David Khourshid](https://github.com/davidkpiano)) is the equivalent of lodash in javascript. This library gives you access to several additional functions to handle lists, maps, strings, etc...

> For the list of available functions provided by sassdash, I let you check the official repository [here](https://github.com/davidkpiano/sassdash).


### Font Awesome 4.4.0

[Font awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) (by [Dave Gandy](https://twitter.com/davegandy)) is a massive font icons set.

If you use font-awesome directly by downloading it, you will have a massive css with all the icons described in it. This is not so optimized cause I don't have any project where I use more than 20 icons maybe.
To handle that, sugar let you specify the icons you want by passing them into the settings like so:

```scss
$settings : (
	// sugar settings...
	font-awesome : (

		// path to font without trailing slash
		font-path : '../fonts/font-awesome',

		// list of icons classes you want
		classes : user gg-circle

	)
)
@include sugar($settings);
```

You will then have in your css only what's necessary for the user and gg-circle icon. This mean that you will have these classes generated:

```fn
.fa-user
.fa-gg-circle
```

> Don't forget to call the @include sugar(classes) mixin in order to have the icons classes...


### Animate.css 3.1.0

[Animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) is a wonderful pre-made animations library made by [Daniel Eden](https://github.com/daneden).

Same as font-awesome, animate.css by default come with all the animations described in the css, but you certainly will need only some of them. In order to generate only the classes and animations you need, you will have to specify them like this:

```scss
// specify the animations you want
$sugar-animatecss : rubberBand tada flipOutX fadeIn;

// init sugar
$settings : (
	// sugar settings...
	animate-css : (

		// animation duration
		duration : 1s,

		// animation easing function
		ease : ease-in-out,

		// fill mode
		fill-mode : both

	)
);
@include sugar($settings);
```

> Unfortunately, for now, due to animate.css package construction, I'm not able to put the list of animations you want in the $settings map.

### Modular scale 2.1.1

[Module scale](https://github.com/modularscale/modularscale-sass/tree/v2.1.1) is a package created by [Scott Kellum](https://github.com/scottkellum). This package can be described like this:

Scott Kellum
: 	A modular scale is a list of values that share the same relationship. These values are often used to size type and create a sense of harmony in a design

Sugar let you use this out of the box. You can setup the package like so:

```scss
$settings : (
	// sugar settings...
	modular-scale : (

		// the modular scale base	
		base 						: 1rem, 			
		
		// the ratio to use
		ratio 						: $golden, 	

		// range		
		range 						: null,

		// is fluid modular scale		
		fluid 						: false 	

	)
)
```

I let you check out the repository to see how this works...


### CSSGram 0.1.2

[CSSGram](https://github.com/una/CSSgram/tree/0.1.2) is a little filter library made by [Una Kravets](https://github.com/una).
This library gives you access to instagram like filters.

To use the filters provides by this library, simply pass the name of the filter you want prefixed by cssgram- to the s-filter mixin like so :

```scss
figure {
	@include s-filter(cssgram-toaster);
}
```
