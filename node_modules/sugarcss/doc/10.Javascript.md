## Javascript

Sugar give you some javascript that can helps you for certain task like webfonts and more coming...

### Webfonts (localstorage)

Sugar allows you to store your font in localstorage to serve them a lot faster than usual. Here's how to use this feature:

#### sugar-webfonts.js

You need to integrate the sugar-webfonts.js micro file in your head (before your stylesheet etc...)

```markup
<head>
	<!-- title, metas, etc... -->
	<script src="{js}/sugar-webfonts.js"></script>
	<script>
		SugarWebfonts.init({
			json_path : '/fonts/fonts.json#{version}'
		});
	</script>
</head>
```

#### fonts.json

Then you need to specify your fonts in a json file like this.

```javascript
{
	"fonts" : [{
    	"font-family" : "Open Sans",
    	"font-weight" : 400,
    	"font-style" : "normal",
    	"src" : "url(data:application/font-woff;base64,d09GRgABAAAAAE8YABIAAAAAhWwAAQABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABHREVGAAABlAAAABYAAAAWABAA... format('woff')"
    }, {
    	"font-family" : "Cousine",
    	"font-weight" : "normal",
    	"font-style" : "normal",
    	"src" : "url(data:application/font-woff;base64,d09GRgABAAAAAE8YABIAAAAAhWwAAQABAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABHREVGAAABlAAAABYAAAAWABAA... format('woff')"
    }]
}
```

> Your source font need to be base64 encoded to be able of been stored in localstorage

#### Under the hood

Sugar webfonts will check if your fonts are in localstorage and if the version is up to date. If not, the json file will be fetched to get your fonts and store them in user localstorage. Then it will inject your fonts in the head before the page is being rendered. That will make the display of your fonts a lot quicker and avoid the font flicker effect that we all know...


### transitionstart event

For now, the transitionstart event does not exist in our browsers. That's a shame cause it can be very helpful (for example in the motion blur effect).
To handle that, sugar gives you a micro javascript file and some simple scss mixins to make that happend.

```markup
<script src="js/sugar-transitionstart.js"></script>
```

```scss
.my-cool-element-that-need-to-trigger-transitionstart-event {
    background: red;
    @include s-transition(all .2s ease-in-out); // need to use the s-transition mixin in order to work

    &:hover {
        background: blue;
        @include s-transitionstart(); // make the transitionstart event been fired
    }
}
```


### DOMNodeInserted event

It can be hard to detect when an element is inserted in the DOM in order to process it in javascript.
Sugar gives you a nice alternative to trigget this event on the elements you are interested.

```markup
<script src="js/sugar-domnodeinserted.js"></script>
```

```scss
.my-element-in-which-im-interested {
    @include s-domnodeinserted(); // this will make each elements trigger the DOMNodeInserted event

    // the trick use an animation to work so if you need to apply others animations, use this instead
    @include s-animation(domnodeinserted(), my-cool-animation .2s ease-in-out);
}
```
