<h1 class="page-header">High Performance Hockey Training Program</h1>

<p>Since 2008, we've been training some of the region's top hockey players as they prepare for their upcoming seasons.</p>

<p>There have been dozens of professional, NCAA/CIS (both male and female), and OHL level players through our doors, not to mention hundreds of Junior and minor hockey players who have all taken on the challenge of a serious, properly structured strength and conditioning program. </p>

<p>To learn more about the general programming philosphy and approach to the high performance program, please watch the webinar posted below, which was published last year prior to our HP2016 program.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Strength and Conditioning</h3>

<h4>Assessments</h4>
<p>At the start and end of each training block, all players will undergo a comprehensive battery of fitness tests designed to give both the coach, and the athlete a good sense of strengths, weaknesses, and how the training plan should address them. Athletes will be given a full fitness report so that they're aware of the items they need to focus on during the summer.</p>
<img class="img-center-75" src="/assets/images/hp2018-1.png" />
<h4>Training design</h4>
<p>Our training program is designed to address the core athletic qualities that are essential to the game of hockey: A high level of physical strength, explosive speed and power, core stability, and a high level of conditioning and resistance to fatigue.</p>
<p>We structure our program to develop these attibutes simulaneously, but in a series of blocks that build upon each other in a way that allows the athlete to make steady progress, but in a balanced, sensible system that doesn't overstress the athlete to the point of burnout or injury.</p>
<p>Above all, we heavily stress the importance of quality over quantity. We pride ourselves in educating players on the importance of a properly designed warm-up, flawless lifting technique, and recovery strategies that promote growth and help keep the athlete healthy and injury-free.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">On-Ice Skills Development</h3>
<img src="/assets/images/HHlogo.png" style="width:150px;float:right;" />
<p>For the HP2018 program, NLPT has partnered with <a href="http://holistichockey.ca/">Holistic Hockey</a>, founded by local coach and former professional player <a href="http://holistichockey.ca/holistic-hockey-founder-tyler-ertel/">Tyler Ertel</a>, to deliver the on-ice portion of the program. Tyler has over two decades of experience coaching players of all ages, and NLPT is excited to have him on board.</p>

<h4>Program structure</h4>
<p>These skates will be high tempo in nature, with a focus on power skating, edge work, stick and hand skills, as well as challenge hockey IQ, compete drills, and both small and large ice scrimmages.</p>
<p>For questions about the on-ice portion of the program, please email Tyler at <a href="mailto:tyler@holistichockey.ca">tyler@holistichockey.ca</a></p>

<h4>Details</h4>
<p>We are still finalizing dates and ice times for the summer, however all ice sessions will be taking place at the Cambridge Ice Park (2.8km away) and only take place during the July and August months of the program. HP2018 athletes will be permitted to store their equipment at the Ice Park while they go to NLPT to complete their workout.</p>

<h3 class="section-heading">Nutrition and Recovery</h3>

<img class="img-right-40" src="/assets/images/platzmassage.jpg" class="image-right" />

<p>Unlike 10 years ago, it’s no longer just about the training. Nutrition and recovery are now crucial components to an athlete’s development plan and our 2018 program will provide support on both fronts.</p>

<p>Athletes will be required to fill out a nutrition logs which will be evaluated by the NLPT coaching and therapy staff, who will then provide feedback and structured guidance on developing sound athlete-centered nutrition habits. Additionally, pre and post-workout Biosteel supplementation will be provided for each training session.</p>

<p>The HP2018 program will have built in recovery weeks and workouts at strategic points in the summer to ensure athletes stay fresh and ready to perform at times. Pro, NCAA, and OHL athletes will also be provided with complimentary weekly 30-minute massage therapy sessions.</p>
